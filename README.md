# What is this
This repo contains all my aliases, scripts, and general stuff I use to make my workflow easier and quicker.

# How can I use it?
Every path and script is based off the `envfile`, so all you have to do is make sure the `envfile`'s paths match with your system, and you should be good to go. There is one for mac and one for linux, change the zshrc so that it loads the correct envfile. 

# Disclaimer
Use this at your own discretion. I will in no way promise that this won't screw up your system.

# Dependencies
## MacOS
`pip3 install python-dotenv`
